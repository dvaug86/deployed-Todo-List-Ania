This is the first part of a project I want to build. 
I'm using Ania Kubow's tutorial of building an authenticated to do app with PostGres React Node.js and Kinsta.

I read alot and binge tv shows as well as movies. I often pick up a series and dive into it (both books and shows) but then put it down for months. I hate trying to figure out where I left off with tv shows and book series.  I also have a ton of books/movies/shows I'd like to watch/read but without having a million tabs open I usually forget until something a year later reminds me of it and then it gets back on the list until I close the tab that reminded me of it. 

This project is my hope of eliminating a million tabs and having a reference point where I can see those entertainment options consolidated into one easy access point of where I can see the place I have left off at and something I'd like to enjoy in the near future.
